## Reporting an Issue & Submitting a Patch

We use the [dalibo/temboard] project to track issue and review
contributions. Fork the main repository and open a PR against
`master` as usual.


## Development Environment Setup

You can quickly set up a dev env with virtualenv and Docker Compose. Running
development version of UI and agent requires two shells, one for the UI and one
for the agent.

Get temBoard UI and agent sources:

```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dalibo/temboard.git
$ cd temboard/
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dalibo/temboard-agent.git agent/
```

Then, create a virtualenv for Python3.6+ or Python2.7, activate it. Then
install temBoard and pull docker images:

``` console
$ pip install -e . -r requirements-dev.txt
...
$ docker-compose pull
```

Then, bootstrap development with `make devenv`.

``` console
$ make devenv
...
2020-03-24 17:09:05,937 [30557] [migrator        ]  INFO: Database is up to date.
Initialized role temboard and database temboard.
docker-compose up -d

Creating temboard_instance_1 ... done
Creating temboard_agent_1    ... done

$ temboard --debug
...
2020-03-24 17:11:55,997 [ 3551] [temboardui      ]  INFO: Starting temBoard 4.0+master on Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster).
...
2020-03-24 17:11:56,015 [ 3551] [temboardui      ]  INFO: Serving temboardui on https://0.0.0.0:8888
...
```

Go to https://127.0.0.1:8888/ to access temBoard running with your code!

You now need to run an agent and register it in UI. Open a second shell for
managing the agent and execute the following commands.

``` console
$ docker-compose exec agent0 /bin/bash
root@91cd7e12ac3e:/var/lib/temboard-agent# sudo -u postgres hupper -m temboardagent.scripts.agent
 INFO: Starting temboard-agent 8.0.dev0.
 INFO: Found config file /etc/temboard-agent/temboard-agent.conf.
2020-08-11 14:29:45,834 [ 3769] [app             ] DEBUG: Looking for plugin activity.
...
```

Now register the agent in UI, using host `0.0.0.0`, port `2345` and key
`key_for_agent`. The monitored Postgres instance is named `postgres0.dev`.

Beware that two Postgres instance are set up with replication. The primary
instance may be either postgres0 or postgres1. See below for details.


### Execute unit tests

Use pytest to run unit tests:

``` console
$ pytest tests/unit
...
==== 31 passed, 10 warnings in 1.10 seconds ======
$
```


### Execute func tests

Go to tests/func and run docker-compose:

``` console
$ cd tests/func
tests/func/$ docker-compose up --force-recreate --always-recreate-deps --renew-anon-volumes --abort-on-container-exit ui
...
```

Functionnal tests are executed **outside** temboard process. UI is installed and
registered using regular tools : pip, dpkg or yum, auto_configure.sh, etc. A
real Postgres database is set up for the repository

Tests are written in Python with pytest. Tests use selenium to communicate with
the UI.

For development purpose, a `docker-compose.yml` file describe the setup to
execute functionnal tests almost like on Circle CI. The main entry point is
`tests/func/run.sh` which is responsible to install temboard, configure it and
call pytest with selenium parameters.

On failure, the main container, named `ui`, wait for you to enter it and debug.
Project tree is mounted at `/workspace`.

``` console
tests/func/$ docker-compose exec ui /bin/bash
[root@ccb2ec0d78cb workspace]# tests/func/run.sh --pdb -x
â€¦
```


## Testing with Postgres replication

Two postgres instance are up with replication. You can execute a second agent
for it likewise:

``` console
$ docker-compose exec agent1 /bin/bash
root@91cd7e12ac3e:/var/lib/temboard-agent# pip install -e /usr/local/src/temboard-agent/ psycopg2-binary hupper
root@91cd7e12ac3e:/var/lib/temboard-agent# sudo -u postgres hupper -m temboardagent.scripts.agent
 INFO: Starting temboard-agent 8.0.dev0.
 INFO: Found config file /etc/temboard-agent/temboard-agent.conf.
2022-01-11 10:12:55,130 [ 1568] [app             ] DEBUG: Looking for plugin activity.
...
```

bash history is shared amongst these two containers.

In UI, register the second agent with address 0.0.0.0, port 2346 instead of
2345, with the same key `key_for_agent`. The instance FQDN is `postgres1.dev`.

The script `docker/dev-switchover.sh` triggers a switchover between the two
postgres instances. Executing `docker/dev-switchover.sh` one more time restore
the original topology.


## Editing Documentation

The documentation is written in markdown and built with `mkdocs`

``` console
$ mkdocs serve
INFO     -  Building documentation...
INFO     -  Cleaning site directory
INFO     -  The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the "nav" configuration:
              - alerting.md
              - postgres_upgrade.md
INFO     -  Documentation built in 0.42 seconds
INFO     -  [16:21:24] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
...
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the documentation. mkdocs serve has hot
reload while you edit the documentation.


### Throw your development environment

If you want to trash development env, use `docker-compose down -v` and restart
from `make devenv`.


## Entering Monitored PostgreSQL Instance with psql

Use the following command:

``` console
$ docker-compose exec agent0 sudo -iu postgres psql
psql (13.5 (Debian 13.5-0+deb11u1), server 14.1)
WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 14.
         Some psql features might not work.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```


### Monitoring another version of PostgreSQL

You can change the version of the monitored PostgreSQL instance by overriding
docker image in `docker-compose.override.yml`.

``` yml
# file docker-compose.override.yml
version: "2.4"

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:9.5-alpine
```

Now apply changes with `make devenv`. Docker-compose will recreate `postgres`
and `agent` containers, thus you need to install and start the agent as
documented above.


### CSS

temBoard UI mainly relies on `Bootstrap`. The CSS files are compiled with
`SASS`.

In case you want to contribute on the styles, first install the nodeJS dev
dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then you can either build a dist version of the css:
```
grunt sass:dist
```

Or build a dev version which will get updated each time you make a change in
any of the .scss files:
```
grunt watch
```


### Launching Multiple Agents

Default development environment instanciate a single PostgreSQL instance and
it's temBoard agent. Root Makefile offers two targets to help testing bigger
infrastructure :

- `make mass-agents` loops from 2345 to 2400 and instanciate a PostgreSQL
  instance and an agent to monitor it. Each instanciation requires you to type
  `y`. This allows to throttle instanciations and to stop when enough instances
  are up.
- `make clean-agents` trashes every existings instances from 2345 to 2400,
  without interaction. **Agent are not unregistered!**


## Setting Up a Hot Standby

You can managed a hot standby Postgres instance with an agent with a custom
`docker-compose.override.yml`:

``` yaml
# Contents of docker-compose.override.yml

version: '2.4'  # Matches docker-compose.yml version.

volumes:
  data2:
  run2:

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13-alpine  # MUST MATCH secondary service image !
    volumes:
    - ./docker/setup-replication.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup-replication.sh

  secondary:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      PRIMARY_HOST: postgres  # Setting PRIMARY_HOST triggers the standby mode.
    command: postgres -c shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements
    volumes:
    - data2:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    - run2:/var/run/postgresql
    - ./share/sql/pg_stat_statements-create-extension.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/pg_stat_statements-create-extension.sql
    - ./docker/setup-replication.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup-replication.sh

  agent2:
    image: dalibo/temboard-agent
    ports:
    - 2346:2345
    volumes:
    - data2:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    - run2:/var/run/postgresql
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - .:/usr/local/src/temboard/
    - ./agent/:/usr/local/src/temboard-agent/
    links:
    - secondary:secondary.dev
    environment:
      # Persist bash history. Eases reuse of pip install and hupper command when
      # recreating container.
      HISTFILE: /usr/local/src/temboard/docker-agent-bash_history
      TEMBOARD_HOSTNAME: secondary.dev
      TEMBOARD_LOGGING_LEVEL: DEBUG
      TEMBOARD_KEY: key_for_agent
      TEMBOARD_SSL_CA: /usr/local/src/temboard-agent/share/temboard-agent_ca_certs_CHANGEME.pem
      TEMBOARD_SSL_CERT: /usr/local/src/temboard-agent/share/temboard-agent_CHANGEME.pem
      TEMBOARD_SSL_KEY: /usr/local/src/temboard-agent/share/temboard-agent_CHANGEME.key
    command: sleep infinity
```

Start full environment with `make devenv`.

Then, install and run agent like for primary agent:

``` console
$ docker-compose exec agent2 /bin/bash
root@91cd7e12ac3e:/var/lib/temboard-agent# pip install -e /usr/local/src/temboard-agent/ psycopg2-binary hupper
root@91cd7e12ac3e:/var/lib/temboard-agent# sudo -u postgres hupper -m temboardagent.scripts.agent
 INFO: Starting temboard-agent 8.0.dev0.
 INFO: Found config file /etc/temboard-agent/temboard-agent.conf.
2020-08-11 14:29:45,834 [ 3769] [app             ] DEBUG: Looking for plugin activity.
...
```

Finally, register the secondary agent in UI, using host `0.0.0.0`, port `2346`
(**NOT 2345**) and key `key_for_agent`. The monitored Postgres instance is named
`secondary.dev`.
