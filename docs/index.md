temBoard is a powerful management tool for PostgreSQL. You can use it to monitor, optimize or configure multiple PostgreSQL instances.

temBoard is composed of 2 basic elements:

- A lightweight agent to install on every PostgreSQL server to monitor and
  manage.
- A central server controlling the agents, collecting metrics and presenting it on a web UI.


You can set up a complete testing environment based on docker,  follow the
[QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART.md) guide for more details.


For a regular installation, follow the [Installation guide](server_install.md).
